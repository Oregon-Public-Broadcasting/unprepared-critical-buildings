			<h4><b>About</b></h4>
			<p>Data shown here come from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) rapid visual assessments of critical infrastructure throughout the state, done in 2007. It's thorough but not every single building is included. Some small schools are missing. <a href="http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/projects/rvs/">Click here for the raw data and more about the program.</a></p>
			<b>Why is my school or hospital on here twice?</b>
			<p>Each building within a facility has its own entry. For details on how the facility rates overall, click the link next to the building name.</p>
			<b>What is "collapse potential"?</b>
			<p>Buildings were assessed visually and rated based on the likelihood of collapse. Determinations are not absolute but identify buildings needing attention.</p>
			<b>What is "seismic activity"?</b>
			<p>This measurement shows the level of seismic activity, such as earthquakes, in the given location. A building's overall risk depends on both its collapse potential and the likelihood for an earthquake in its location.</p>
			<b>What is "soil type"?</b>
			<p>The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program has defined five soil types, labeled A through E. A is the hardest, E is the softest and will amplify shaking the most. For more info, USGS has a handy guide <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/nca/soiltype/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
			<b>Have any of these buildings been retrofitted?</b>
			<p>Possibly. The state's last assessment was done in 2007. Updated assessments have been recommended but not completed. School districts are required to submit <a href="http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/projects/rvs/activity-updates/status.html" target="_blank">reports to DOGAMI of buildings they've replaced or modified.</a> Upgrades are noted in the table.</p>
